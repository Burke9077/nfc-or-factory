            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
            <p>You'll be shown a series of Pokémon cards one at a time.</p>
            <p>Your task is to determine if each card is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>REAL</strong> - A genuine factory miscut card</li>
                <li><strong>NFC</strong> - A card from real cardstock, but cut outside of the factory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click on your choice, and you'll receive immediate feedback.</p>
            <p>Try to get the highest accuracy score possible!</p>

            <h3>How We Verify Card Authenticity</h3>
            <p>All real cards shown on this site are photos of non-error cards I personally opened from sealed packs. 
            The NFC cards were explicitly purchased as NFCs from third-party sellers.</p>
